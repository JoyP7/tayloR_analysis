Official “Lover” Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover
We could let our friends crash 
In the living room
This is our place, we make the call 
And I’m highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you 
I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey 
But I want them all
Chorus
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover
My heart’s been borrowed 
And yours has been blue 
All’s well that ends well 
To end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true 
To my lover
And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover...
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

Official ‘I Think He Knows’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can’t stop
Go there every night
I think he knows his
Hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it’s mine
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I’m drawing up the plans
It’s like I’m seventeen
Nobody understands 
No one understands He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
I got that uhh, I mean
Want to see what’s under that attitude
I want you
Bless my soul
But I ain’t gotta tell him 
I think he knows
I think he knows I think he knows
When we get all alone
I’ll make myself at home
And he’ll want me to stay
I think he knows
He’d better lock it down
Or I won’t stick around
‘Cause good ones never wait
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I’m drawing up the plans
He’s so obsessed with me and boy 
I understand 
Boy I understand Chorus I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my soul Lyrical smile
Indigo eyes
Hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks I’ll drive
Lyrical smile
Indigo eyes
Hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks
I’ll drive
So where we gonna go? 
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go?
I think he knows Chorus I think he
I want you
Bless my
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my 
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my
I want you
Bless my soul
I want you
Bless my soul
But I ain’t gotta tell him 
I think he knows

Official ‘Cornelia Street’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
ﬁlling in the blanks as we go
As if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead
leading us home And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
That’s the kind of heartbreak
Time could never mend
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again Windows ﬂung right open
Autumn air, jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the ﬂoor
Back when we were card sharks
Playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I Chorus You hold my hand
On the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen... I hope I never lose you 
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again 
Never again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car

Official Lyrics:

In the heat of the fight, I walked away 
Ignoring words that you were saying 
Trying to make me stay 
I said this time, I’ve had enough 
And you’ve called a hundred times 
But I’m not picking up 
Cause I’m so mad, I might tell you that it’s over 
But if you look a little closer 

I said leave, but all I really want is you 
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
Screaming I’m in love with you 
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more 
And don’t you leave, cause I know all I need 
Is on the other side of the door 

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone 
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone 
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door 
And all the things that I misread 
So babe, if you know everything 
Tell me why you couldn’t see 
When I left I wanted you to chase after me, yeah 

Repeat chorus 

And I’ll scream out the window 
I can’t even look at you 
I don’t need you, but I do, I do, I do 
I’ll say there’s nothing you can say 
To make this right again 
I mean it . . . I mean it 
What I mean is 

I said leave, but baby all I want is you 
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles 
Screaming I’m in love with you 
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more 
And don’t you leave, cause I know all I need 
Is on the other side of the door 

With your face and the beautiful eyes 
And the conversation with the little white lies 
And the faded picture of a beautiful night, you 
Carried me from your car up the stairs 
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess 
After everything and that little black dress 
After everything I must confess I need you

Official Lyrics:
 
There’s something ‘bout the way 
The street looks when it’s just rained 
There’s a glow off the pavement 
You walk me to the car 
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there 
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah 
Oh, yeah 

We’re driving down the road 
I wonder if you know 
I’m trying so hard not to get caught up now 
But you’re just so cool, run your hands through your hair 
Absentmindedly makin’ me want you 

And I don’t know how it gets better than this 
You take my hand and drag me headfirst 
Fearless 
And I don’t know why but with you I’d dance 
In a storm in my best dress 
Fearless 

So baby drive slow till we run out of road 
In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here 
In this passenger seat 
You put your eyes on me In this moment now 
Capture it, remember it 

Repeat chorus 
Oh, oh 

Well you stood there with me in the doorway 
My hands shake, I’m not usually this way but 
You pull me in and I’m a little more brave 
It’s a first kiss, it’s flawless, really something 
It’s fearless 
Oh, yeah 

Repeat chorus 
Repeat chorus
 
Oh, oh 
Oh, yeah

Official Lyrics:

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky 
I’m reaching out and I just can't tell you why 
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you 
Untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
And when you're close I feel like coming undone 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

It's half full and I won't wait here all day 
I know you’re saying that you'd be here anyway 
But you’re untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone

 In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon, oh 

In the middle of the night waking from this dream 
I wanna feel you by my side standing next to me 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

I’m caught up in you, oh, oh 

But you’re untouchable burning brighter than the sun 
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon, oh 

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we’ll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
C’mon 

In the middle of the night waking from this dream 
I wanna feel you by my side standing next to me 
You gotta c’mon c’mon 
Say that we'll be together 
C’mon c’mon 
Little taste of heaven 

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream 
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name 
You gotta c’mon c’mon, oh 
C’mon c’mon 
C’mon c’mon, oh oh oh oh 

It’s like a million little stars spelling out your name 
Spelling out your name, oh

Official ‘Afterglow’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

I blew things out of proportion
Now you’re blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
Fighting with a true love
Is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry ‘til it blows up, ‘til there’s no us 
Why’d I have to break what I love so much?
It’s on your face
And I’m to blame
I need to say Hey, it’s all me, in my head
I’m the one who burned us down
But it’s not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you 
I don’t wanna do
I don’t wanna do this to you 
I don’t wanna lose
I don’t wanna lose this with you
I need to say
Hey it’s all me, just don’t go
Meet me in the afterglow It’s so excruciating to see you low
Just want to lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the ﬁght, oh
I lived like an island
Punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why’d I have to break what I love so much
It’s on your face
Don’t walk away I need to say Chorus Tell me that you’re still mine
Tell me that we’ll be just ﬁne
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it’s not my fault
Tell me that I’m all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
Chorus

Official lyrics for ""The Archer"" written by Taylor Swift:

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I saw I don't want that
But what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up,
It's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And i cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through me
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
Combat
I'm ready for combat

Official ‘Paper Rings’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

The moon is high like your friends were
the night that we ﬁrst met 
Went home and tried to stalk you on the Internet
Now I’ve read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold like the shoulder
that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Kiss me once ‘cause you know I had a long night
Kiss me twice ‘cause it’s gonna be all right
Three times ‘cause I waited my whole life I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want and
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want
In paper rings
In picture frames
In dirty dreams
You’re the one I want

In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in ﬁrst, I went in too 
I’m with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back to the color
that we painted your brother’s wall
Honey without all the exes, ﬁghts, and ﬂaws
We wouldn’t be standing here so tall so
Kiss you once ‘cause you know I had a long night
Kiss you twice ‘cause it’s gonna be all right
Three times ‘cause you waited your whole life Chorus I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me baby boy I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that’s right
You’re the one I want 
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, darling
You’re the one I want I like shiny things
But I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh huh,
That’s right, darling
You’re the one I want and
I hate accidents
Except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, 
That’s right, darling 
You’re the one I want In paper rings
In picture frames
In all my dreams
You’re the one I want
In paper rings
In picture frames
In all my dreams
You’re the one I want

Official Lyrics:
 
Say you’re sorry, that face of an angel 
Comes out just when you need it to 
As I paced back and forth all this time 
Cause I honestly believed in you 
Holding on the days drag on 
Stupid girl, I should’ve known 
I should’ve known, that 

I’m not a princess, this ain’t a fairytale 
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain’t Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now it’s too late for you and your white horse 
To come around 

Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes 
And never really had a chance 
Well, my mistake, I didn’t know to be in love 
You had to fight to have the upper hand 
I had so many dreams about you and me 
Happy endings, well now I know 

Repeat chorus 

And there you are on your knees 
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
Just like I always wanted, but I’m so sorry. . . 

Cause I’m not your princess, this ain’t our fairytale 
I’m gonna find someone someday 
Who might actually treat me well 
This is a big world, that was a small town 
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now 
And it’s too late for you and your white horse 
Now it’s too late for you and your white horse 
To catch me now 

Oh, try and catch me now 
Oh, it’s too late to catch me now

Official “Lover” Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover
We could let our friends crash 
In the living room
This is our place, we make the call 
And I’m highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you 
I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey 
But I want them all
Chorus
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover
My heart’s been borrowed 
And yours has been blue 
All’s well that ends well 
To end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true 
To my lover
And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover...
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

Official ‘False God’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I’d die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d ﬂy to you
And I can’t talk to you when you’re like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town - I’m New York City
I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you
get lost when you’re led by blind faith
Blind faith But we might just get away with it
Religion’s in your lips
Even if it’s a false god
We’d still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it’s a false god
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love I know heaven’s a thing
I go there when you touch me
honey, hell is when I ﬁght with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and
we’re begging for forgiveness,
got the wine for you
And you can’t talk to me when I’m like this
Daring you to leave me
just so I can try and scare you,
you’re the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you
get lost when you’re led by blind faith
Blind faith 
Still worship this love
Even if it’s a false god
Even if it’s a false god
Still worship this love

Official Lyrics:

You said, “I know” 
When I said, “I need some time, need some space 
To think about all of this” 
And you watched me go 
And I knew my words were hard to hear 
And harder to ever take back 
And I said, 
“When can I come back?” 
And you said 

That’s when 
When I wake up in the morning 
That’s when 
When it’s sunny or storming 
Laughing, when I’m crying 
And that’s when 
I’ll be waiting at the front gate 
That’s when 
When I see your face 
I’ll let you in 
And baby that’s when 

I said, “I know” 
When you said, “I did you wrong 
Made mistakes, and put you through all of this” 
Then through the phone 
Came all your tears 
And I said, “Leave those all in our past” 
And you said, “When can I come back?”
And I said 

Repeat chorus 

And you said, “Honestly, 
When you were gone 
Did you ever think of me?” 
And I said 
That’s when 
When I woke up in the morning 
That’s when 
It was sunny or storming 
Laughing 
When I was crying 
And that’s when you were waiting at the front gate 
That’s when, when I saw your face 
You let me in, and baby that’s when 

When I’m laughing 
When I’m crying 

That’s when I miss you 
That’s when I want you 
That’s when I love you 
That’s when

►Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

Official Lyrics:
 
I took a chance, I took a shot 
And you might think I’m bulletproof, but I’m not 
You took a swing, I took it hard 
And down here from the ground I see who you are 

I’m sick and tired of your attitude 
I’m feeling like I don’t know you 
You tell me that you love me then cut me down 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you’re around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 

Well you could write a book on how to ruin someone’s perfect day 
Well I get so confused and frustrated 
Forget what I’m trying to say, oh 

I’m sick and tired of your reasons 
I got no one to believe in 
You tell me that you want me, then push me around 
And I need you like a heartbeat 
But you know you got a mean streak 
Makes me run for cover when you’re around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 

Why…do you have to make me feel small 
So you can feel whole inside? 
Why…do you have to put down my dreams 
So you’re the only thing on my mind? 

Well, I’m sick and tired of your attitude 
Feeling like I don’t know you 
You tell me that you want me then cut me down 
I’m sick and tired of your reasons 
I’ve got no one to believe in 
You ask me for my love then you push me around 
Here’s to you and your temper 
Yes, I remember what you said last night 
And I know that you see what you’re doing to me 
Tell me why 
Why, tell me why, oh 

I take a step back, let you go 
I told you I’m not bulletproof 
Now you know

fficial lyrics for ""The Archer"" 
written by Taylor Swift

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I saw I don't want that
But what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up,
It's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And i cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through me
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay
Combat
I'm ready for combat

Official Lyrics:

Hey
I knew I’d run into you somewhere 
It’s been a while, I didn’t mean to stare 
I heard she’s nothing like me 
I’m sure she’ll make you happy 

But don’t you 
Don’t you smile at me and ask me how I’ve been 
Don’t you say you’ve missed me if you don’t want me again 
You don’t know how much I feel I love you still 
So why don’t you 
Don’t you 

Sometimes 
I really wish that I could hate you 
I’ve tried 
But that’s just something I can’t do 
My heart knows what the truth is 
I swore I wouldn’t do this 

Repeat chorus 

So I’ll walk out of here tonight 
Tried to go on with my life 
And you can say we’re still friends 
But I don’t want to pretend 
So if I see you again 

Repeat chorus 
Don’t you

Official Lyrics:
 
He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it’s 2am and I'm cursing your name 
So in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush A
nd I never knew I could feel that much
And that’s the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

Repeat chorus 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
So in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
And that’s the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
That's the way I loved you

Official “Lover” Lyrics

Written by Taylor Swift

 

We could leave the Christmas lights up

‘Til January

This is our place, we make the rules

And there’s a dazzling haze

A mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?

Forever and ever

Take me out

And take me home

You’re my, my, my, my...

Lover

We could let our friends crash

In the living room

This is our place, we make the call

And I’m highly suspicious

That everyone who sees you wants you

I’ve loved you 3 summers now, honey

But I want them all

Chorus

Ladies and gentlemen

Will you please stand

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man

To be my lover

My heart’s been borrowed

And yours has been blue

All’s well that ends well

To end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true

To my lover

And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes

For me

And at every table, I’ll save you a seat

Lover...

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?

Forever and ever

Take me out

And take me home

You’re my, my, my, my...

Oh you’re my, my, my, my...

Darling you’re my, my, my, my...

Lover

Official Lyrics:
 
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around 
I’ve been giving out chances every time 
And all you do is let me down 
And it’s taken me this long baby but I figured you out 
And you’re thinking we’ll be fine again but not this time around 

You don’t have to call anymore 
I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
Don’t wanna to hurt anymore 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no, no, no 

You’re looking so innocent
 I might believe you if I didn’t know 
Could’ve loved you all my life 
If you hadn’t left me waiting in the cold 
And you got your share of secrets 
And I’m tired of being last to know 
And now you’re asking me to listen cause it’s worked each time before 

But you don’t have to call anymore I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
Don’t wanna hurt anymore 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 

You had me crawling for you honey 
And it never would’ve gone away no 
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade 

So you don’t have to call anymore 
I won’t pick up the phone 
This is the last straw 
There’s nothing left to beg for 
And you can tell me that you’re sorry 
But I don’t believe you baby 
Like I did before 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
You’re not sorry. . .no, no 
No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no 
No, no, no, no

Official ‘It’s Nice To Have A Friend’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

School bell rings 
Walk me home 
Sidewalk chalk 
Covered in snow 
Lost my gloves 
You give me one 
Wanna hang out
Yeah sounds like fun 
Video games
You pass me a note 
Sleeping in tents
It’s nice to have a friend 
It’s nice to have a friend Light pink sky 
Up on the roof 
Sun sinks down 
No curfew
20 questions 
We tell the truth
You been stressed out lately 
Yeah me too
Something gave 
you the nerve
To touch my hand
It’s nice to have a friend
It’s nice to have a friend Church bells ring 
Carry me home 
Rice on the ground 
Looks like snow 
Call my bluff
Call you babe 
Have my back, yeah 
Every day
Feels like home 
Stay in bed
The whole weekend
It’s nice to have a friend 
It’s nice to have a friend
It’s nice to have a friend

Official Lyrics:

I could go back to every laugh 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore 
And I know all the steps up to your door 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore 

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky 
Talk to the man with the reasons why 
And let me know what you find 
I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I could stand up and sing you a song 
But I don’t wanna have to go that far 
And I, I’ve got you down 
I know you by heart and you don’t even know where I start 

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
 Talk to the man who put you here 
And don’t wait for the sky to clear 

I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I’ve watched you so long, screamed your name 
I don’t know what else I can say 

I’ll leave my window open 
Cause I’m too tired at night for all these games 
Just know I’m right here hoping 
That you’ll come in with the rain 

I could go back to every laugh 
But I don’t wanna go there anymore

Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

Our 'Footnotes' series fills in fans on the particulars of its videos, and in the best cases, reveals a few secrets, too. That was the case when we connected with Taylor Swift for info regarding the writing and shooting of ""cardigan"" from her new 'folklore' album - she really dug deep to give us the goods. This episode is teeming with narrative details. Watch closely and learn about TS's grandfather, her painting skills, the songs' relationship to each other, and the clever plot device that serves as a very resonant metaphor. Taylor had a lot in mind when she was directing the vid, and there's PLENTY to be absorbed in this edition of Footnotes. Share it with a pal.

Official ‘Death By A Thousand Cuts’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
The morning comes and
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’
And what once was ours
Is no one’s now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
If the story’s over
Why am I still writing pages? Chorus My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I’m searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, United we stand
Our country
Guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn’t take up
Gave you too much but it wasn’t enough
But I’ll be all right
It’s just a thousand cuts I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
No it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
My body, my love
But it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, no, no I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’

Official ‘Cruel Summer’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff & Annie Clark

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night 
You know that I caught it
bad bad boy
Shiny toy, with a price 
You know that I bought it 
killing me slow
Out the window
I’m always waiting for you to be waiting below Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes 
What doesn’t kill me 
Makes me want you more And it’s new
The shape of your body 
It’s blue
The feeling I got and it’s 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
It’s cool
That’s what I tell ‘em
No rules in breakable heaven but 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
With you Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I’m not dying
We say that we’ll just screw 
it up in these trying times
We’re not trying 
So cut the headlights
Summer’s a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone 
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you’ll be the last to know Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer 
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’ He looks up grinning like a devil Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’

Official Lyrics:

This is wrong but I can’t help but feel like 
There ain’t nothin’ more right babe 
Misty morning comes again and I can’t 
Help but wish I could see your face 
I knew from the first note played 
I’d be breaking all my rules to see you 
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row 
Scream your name 

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
I can’t keep my eyes off of you 
I’m no one special, just another wide eyed girl 
Who’s desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall 
Superstar 

Morning loneliness 
Comes around when I’m not dreaming about you 
But when my world wakes up today 
You’ll be in another town 
And I knew when I saw your face 
I’d be counting down the ways to see you 
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row 
Scream your name 

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like 
I can’t take my eyes off of you 
I’m no one special, just another wide eyed girl 
Who’s desperately in love with you 
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall 
Superstar 

You played in bars, you play guitar 
I’m invisible and everyone knows who you are 
And you’ll never see you sing me to sleep 
Every night from the radio 

Repeat 2nd chorus 
Sweet, sweet superstar 
Superstar

Official ‘Daylight’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift 

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven
I’ll tell you the truth but never goodbye I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it’s morning now
It’s brighter now, now Chorus And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it’s golden And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York
Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it’s golden
Like daylight I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I could never look away
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
Like daylight
It’s golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight
And let it go
Just let it go
Let it go Spoken: 
“I want to be defined by the things that I love. Not the things I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. I just think that... you are what you love.”

Official Lyrics:
 
Well it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you 
Somebody else gets what you wanted again 
You know it’s all the same, another time and place 
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it 
But I believe in whatever you do 
And I’ll do anything to see it through 

Because these things will change
 Can you feel it now? 
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come 
For us to finally win 
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah 
Oh, oh 

So we’ve been outnumbered 
Raided and now cornered 
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair 
We’re getting stronger now 
Find things they never found 
They might be bigger 
But we’re faster and never scared 
You can walk away, say we don’t need this 
But there’s something in your eyes 
Says we can beat this 

Repeat chorus 

Tonight we’ll stand, get off our knees 
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years 
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives 
But we’ll stand up champions tonight 

It was the night things changed 
Can you see it now? 
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down 
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up 
Cause we never gave in 
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
Hallelujah

Official ‘cardigan’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner

Vintage tee, brand new phone High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you Dancing in your Levi’s
Drunk under a streetlight I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt Baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and Giving me your weekends I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line Once in twenty lifetimes
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars But now I’m bleeding

Cause I knew you Stepping on the last train
 
Marked me like a bloodstain I knew you
Tried to change the ending Peter losing Wendy
I knew you
Leaving like a father Running like water
When you are young they assume you know nothing But I knew you’d linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you’d haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I’d curse you for the longest time Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you’d miss me once the thrill expired And you’d be standing in my front porch light And I knew you’d come back to me
You’d come back to me And you’d come back to me And you’d come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan Under someone’s bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Official “False God” Lyrics

Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

 

We were crazy to think

Crazy to think that this could work

Remember how I said I’d die for you

We were stupid to jump

In the ocean separating us

Remember how I’d ﬂy to you

And I can’t talk to you when you’re like this

Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town - I’m New York City

I still do it for you babe

They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you

get lost when you’re led by blind faith

Blind faith But we might just get away with it

Religion’s in your lips

Even if it’s a false god

We’d still worship

We might just get away with it

The altar is my hips

Even if it’s a false god

We’d still worship this love

We’d still worship this love

We’d still worship this love I know heaven’s a thing

I go there when you touch me

honey, hell is when I ﬁght with you

But we can patch it up good

Make confessions and

we’re begging for forgiveness,

got the wine for you

And you can’t talk to me when I’m like this

Daring you to leave me

just so I can try and scare you,

you’re the West Village

You still do it for me babe

They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you

get lost when you’re led by blind faith

Blind faith

Still worship this love

Even if it’s a false god

Even if it’s a false god

Still worship this love

Official ‘Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

You know I adore you
I’m crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen
Lost in a ﬁlm scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I’m lost in the lights
American glory
Faded before me
Now I’m feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It’s been a long time coming but It’s you and me
That’s my whole world 
They whisper in the hallway 
She’s a bad bad girl
The whole school is rolling fake dice 
You play stupid games 
You win stupid prizes
It’s you and me
There’s nothing like this
Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince
We’re so sad, we paint the town blue 
Voted most likely to run away with you My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high ﬁves
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories
Burning before me
I’m feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then
Where are the wise men?
Darling I’m scared
No cameras catch my mufﬂed cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there And now the storm is coming but Chorus And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I think you should come home 
And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I think you should come home
And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN! I just thought you should know
And I’ll never let you GO!
‘Cause I know this is a FIGHT!
That someday we’re gonna WIN! It’s you and me
That’s my whole world 
They whisper in the hallway
She’s a bad bad girl
I just thought you should know
It’s you and me
There’s nothing like this
Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince
We’re so sad, we paint the town blue 
Voted most likely to run away with you And I don’t want you to GO!
I don’t really wanna FIGHT!
‘Cause nobody’s gonna WIN!
I think you should come home 
And I’ll never let you GO!
‘Cause I know this is a FIGHT!
That someday we’re gonna WIN!
I just thought you should know It’s you and me
That’s my whole world
They whisper in the hallway 
She’s a bad bad girl
She’s a bad bad girl

Official Lyrics:
 
I’m five years old it’s getting cold I’ve got my big coat on 
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run 
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides look now the sky is gold 
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home 

I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall 
But I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I’m thirteen now and don’t know how my friends could be so mean
 I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away 
And we talk and window shop till I’ve forgotten all their names 

I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel ok 
But I know I had the best day with you today 

I have an excellent father 
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out he’s better than I am 

I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 

There is a video I found from back when I was three 
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you’re talking to me 
It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
Daddy’s smart and you’re the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
For staying back and watching me shine and I didn't know if you knew 
So I’m taking this chance to say that I had the best day with you today

""Christmas Tree Farm"" Lyrics by Taylor Swift:

My winter nights are taken up by static, stress and holiday shopping traffic 
But I close my eyes and I’m somewhere else - just like magic...

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow 
And I just wanna be there tonight 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon 
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too 
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm 
There’s a light in the barn 
We’d run inside out from the cold 
In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they’re warm and they’re safe 
They wake to see a blanket of snow 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms 
Takes me back to that little farm 
Where every wish comes true
Oh baby, yeah
And when I’m feeling alone
You remind me of home
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn’t fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas…to you
Under the mistletoe…to you
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

I love you

exile feat. bon iver - lyrics:
written by taylor swift, william bowery & justin vernon

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughing but the joke’s not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holding all this love out here in the hall

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before

I can see you staring, honey
Like he’s just your understudy
Like you’d get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
I’m not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before
So I’m leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn’t even hear me out
(Didn’t even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind
(Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn’t turn things around
(You never turned things around)
Cause you never gave a warning sign
(I gave so many signs)
(So many signs)
(So many signs)
You didn’t even see the signs

I think I’ve seen this film before
And I didn’t like the ending
You’re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I’m in exile seeing you out
I think I’ve seen this film before

So I’m leaving out the side door

""Christmas Tree Farm"" Lyrics by Taylor Swift:

My winter nights are taken up by static, stress and holiday shopping traffic 
But I close my eyes and I’m somewhere else - just like magic...

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow 
And I just wanna be there tonight 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon 
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too 
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm 
There’s a light in the barn 
We’d run inside out from the cold 
In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they’re warm and they’re safe 
They wake to see a blanket of snow 
Sweet dreams 
Of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there, too
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 
Just being in your arms 
Takes me back to that little farm 
Where every wish comes true
Oh baby, yeah
And when I’m feeling alone
You remind me of home
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn’t fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas…to you
Under the mistletoe…to you
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, I love you 

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

I love you

Official ‘I Forgot That You Existed’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Louis Bell & Adam King Feeney

How many days did I spend thinking
‘Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong 
Lived in the shade you were throwing
‘Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone 
And I couldn’t get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah 
Your name on my lips, tongue tied
Free rent living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night... I forgot that you existed 
And I thought that it 
would kill me
But it didn’t
And it was so nice 
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed 
It isn’t love it isn’t hate 
It’s just indifference
I forgot that you... Got out some popcorn as soon as my rep started going down, down, down 
Laughed on the schoolyard as soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would’ve stuck around for ya 
Would’ve fought the whole town, so yeah 
Would’ve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show 
But you showed who you are 
Then one magical night... Chorus Sent me a clear message 
Taught me some hard lessons 
I just forget what they were... 
It’s all just a blur I forgot that you existed 
And I thought that it 
would kill me
But it didn’t
And it was so nice 
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed 
I did, I did, I did
It isn’t hate it’s just indifference
It isn’t love it isn’t hate 
It’s just indifference
So yeah...

Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

Official Lyrics:
 
I see your face in my mind as I drive away 
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way 
People are people and sometimes we change our minds 
But it’s killing me to see you go after all this time 

Mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . 
Mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm . . . 

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie 
It’s the kinda ending you don’t really wanna see 
Cause it’s tragedy and it’ll only bring you down 
Now I don’t know what to be without you around 

And we know it’s never simple, never easy 
Never a clean break, no one here to save me 
You’re the only thing I know like the back of my hand 
And I can’t breathe without you, but I have to 
Breathe without you, but I have to 

Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt 
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve 
But people are people and sometimes it doesn’t work out 
And nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout 

Repeat chorus 

It’s 2am, feeling like I just lost a friend 
Hope you know it’s not easy, easy for me 
It’s 2am, feeling like I just lost a friend 
I hope you know this ain’t easy, easy for me 

And we know it’s never simple, never easy 
Never a clean break, no one here to save me 
Oh, I can’t breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to 
Breathe without you, but I have to 

I’m sorry
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry
I’m sorry 
I’m sorry

Official Lyrics:

Once upon a time 
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye 
And we caught onto something 
I hold onto the night 
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me 

Were you just kidding? 
Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down 
We almost never speak 
I don't feel welcome anymore 
Baby what happened, please tell me 

Cause one second it was perfect 
Now you're halfway out the door 
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when he said forever and always 
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 

Was I out of line? 
Did I say something way too honest? 
Made you run and hide Like a scared little boy 
I looked into your eyes 
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure 
So here's to everything coming down to nothing 
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core 
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore 

Repeat chorus 

You didn't mean it baby 
I don't think so 

Oh back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 
Back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 

Cause it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when we said forever and always 
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 
You didn’t mean it baby 
You said forever and always, yeah

Official Lyrics:
 
Mr. perfect face
Mr. here to stay
Mr. looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr. I’ve been waiting for you all my life
Mr. every single day until the end I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know
Mr. change of heart
Mr. leaves me all alone
I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it’s wonderful to see that you’re okay

Hello, Mr. perfectly fine
How’s your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. always at the right place at the right time, baby
Hello, Mr. casually cruel
Mr. everything revolves around you
I’ve been Miss misery since your goodbye
And you’re Mr. perfectly fine

Mr. never told me why
Mr. never had to see me cry
Mr. insincere apology so he doesn’t look like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you’re all the same
Because I hear he’s got his arm ‘round a brand new girl
I’ve been picking up my heart
He’s been picking up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it’s wonderful to see that it never phased you

Repeat chorus

So dignified in your well pressed suit
So strategized
All the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It’s the best seat
In the best room
Oh, he’s so smug
Mr. always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it’s really such a shame
It’s such a shame
Cause I was Miss here to stay
Now I’m Miss gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you’ll miss me
But by then you’ll be Mr. too late

Goodbye, Mr. perfectly fine
How’s your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. always at the right place at the right time, baby
Goodbye, Mr. casually cruel
Mr. everything revolves around you
I’ve been Miss misery for the last time
And you’re Mr. perfectly fine
You’re perfectly fine
Mr. look me in the eye and tell me you

►Official Lover REMIX feat. Shawn Mendes Lyrics:

We could leave the Christmas lights up 
‘Til January
This is our place, we make the rules 
And there’s a dazzling haze
A mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover

We could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young 
Would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop 
I’ll sing love songs to you when we’re eighty
See I finally got you now, honey
I won’t let you fall

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close? 
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand 
I take this magnetic force of a man
To be my lover

Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth 
The girl in my story, has always been you
I’d go down with the Titanic, it’s true 
For you… 
Lover

And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes 
For me
And at every table, I’ll save you a seat 
Lover…

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You’re my, my, my, my... 
Oh you’re my, my, my, my... 
Darling you’re my, my, my, my...
Lover

Official Lyrics:
 
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors 
It’s the morning of your very first day 
You say hi to your friends you ain’t seen in a while 
Try and stay out of everybody’s way 
It’s your freshman year and you’re gonna be here 
For the next four years in this town 
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say 
You know I haven’t seen you around, before 

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen, feeling like 
There’s nothing to figure out 
Well count to ten, take it in 
This is life before you know 
Who you’re gonna be 
At fifteen 

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail 
And soon enough you’re best friends 
Laughing at the other girls who think they’re so cool 
We’ll be out of here as soon as we can 
And then you’re on your very first date and he’s got a car 
And you’re feeling like flying 
And your mama’s waiting up and you’re thinking he’s the one 
And you’re dancing ‘round your room when the night ends 
When the night ends

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen and your first kiss 
Makes your head spin around well 
In your life you’ll do things greater than 
Dating the boy on the football team 
I didn’t know it at fifteen 

When all you wanted was to be wanted 
Wish you could go back 
And tell yourself what you know now 

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday 
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine 
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
Who changed his mind 
And we both cried 

Cause when you’re fifteen and 
Somebody tells you they love you 
You’re gonna believe them 
And when you’re fifteen, don’t forget to look before you fall 
But I’ve found time can heal most anything 
And you just might find who you’re supposed to be 
I didn’t know who I was supposed to be 
At fifteen 

La la la la la La la la la la 
La la la la la 

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl 
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Official ‘Death By A Thousand Cuts’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
The morning comes and
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’
And what once was ours
Is no one’s now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
If the story’s over
Why am I still writing pages? Chorus My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I’m searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, United we stand
Our country
Guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn’t take up
Gave you too much but it wasn’t enough
But I’ll be all right
It’s just a thousand cuts I get drunk but it’s not enough ‘cause
You’re not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier’s still flickering here
‘Cause I can’t pretend it’s ok when it’s not
No it’s not
It’s death by a thousand cuts
Trying to find a part of me that you didn’t touch
My body, my love
But it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, no, no I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it’ll be all right
They say ‘I don’t know’

Official Lyrics:

We used to walk along the streets
 When the porch lights were shining bright 
Before I had somewhere to be 
Back when we had all night 
And we were happy 
I do recall, a good while back 
We snuck into the circus 
You threw your arms around my neck 
Back when I deserved it 
And we were happy 

When it was good, baby 
It was good, baby 
We showed ‘em all up 
No one could touch the way we 
Laughed in the dark 
Talking ‘bout your daddy’s farm 
We were gonna buy someday 
And we were happy 

We used to watch the sun go down 
On the boats in the water 
That’s sorta how I feel right now 
And goodbye’s so much harder 
Cause we were happy 

Repeat chorus 
We were happy 

Oh, I hate those voices 
Telling me I’m not in love anymore 
But they don’t give me choices 
And that’s what these tears are for 
Cause we were happy 
We were happy 

When it was good, baby 
It was good, baby 
We showed ‘em all up 
No one could touch the way we 
Laughed in the dark 
Talking ‘bout your daddy’s farm 
And you were gonna marry me 
And we were happy 
We were happy 
Oh, we were happy

Official Lyrics:
 
Once upon a time 
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye 
And we caught onto something 
I hold onto the night 
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me 

Were you just kidding? 
Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down 
We almost never speak 
I don't feel welcome anymore 
Baby what happened, please tell me 

Cause one second it was perfect 
Now you're halfway out the door 
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when he said forever and always 
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 

Was I out of line? 
Did I say something way too honest? 
Made you run and hide Like a scared little boy 
I looked into your eyes 
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure 
So here's to everything coming down to nothing 
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core 
Where is this going? 
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore 

Repeat chorus 

You didn't mean it baby 
I don't think so 

Oh back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 
Back up, baby, back up 
Did you forget everything? 

Cause it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called 
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all 
And you flash back to when we said forever and always 
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong 
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 
Cause I was there when you said forever and always 
You didn’t mean it baby 
You said forever and always, yeah

Official ‘The Man’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Joel Little

I would be complex 
I would be cool
They’d say I played the ﬁeld before I found someone to commit to 
And that would be ok
For me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you 
I’d be a fearless leader
I’d be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya 
What’s that like? I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man They’d say I hustled 
Put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve 
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I’d be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez Chorus What’s it like to brag about 
Raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models 
And it’s all good if you’re bad 
And it’s okay if you’re mad If I was out ﬂashing my dollars 
I’d be a bitch, not a baller 
They paint me out to be bad 
So it’s okay that I’m mad I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’m so sick of running as fast I can 
Wondering if I’d get there quicker 
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them coming at me again 
‘Cause if I was a man...
Then I’d be the man 
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
I’d be the man
If I was a man
I’d be the man

Official Lyrics:
 
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you 
And as we walked we were talking I didn’t say half the things I wanted to 
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window I’ll be the one waiting there even when it’s cold Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing 
I don’t always have to be alone 

Cause I can’t help it if you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself 

Hey Stephen, I’ve been holding back this feeling so I’ve got some things to say to you 
I’ve seen it all so I thought but I never seen nobody shine the way you do 
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It’s beautiful, wonderful don’t you ever change 
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving I think you and I should stay the same 

Repeat chorus 

They’re dimming the street lights, you’re perfect for me why aren’t you here tonight 
I’m waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near 
And shine, shine, shine 

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons why I should be the one you choose 
All those other girls, well they’re beautiful but would they write a song for you 

I can’t help it if you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself

If you look like an angel 
Can’t help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I’ve been feeling since I met you 
Can’t help it if there’s no one else 
I can’t help myself 
Myself, can’t help myself 
I can’t help myself

Official ‘Soon You’ll Get Better’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor’s ofﬁce lighting
I didn’t tell you I was scared
That was the ﬁrst time we were there
Holy orange bottles
Each night I pray to you
Desperate people ﬁnd faith
So now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon
‘Cause you have to I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses
You make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn’t real
I’ll paint the kitchen neon
I’ll brighten up the sky
I know I’ll never get it
There’s not a day that I won’t try
And I’ll say to you Chorus And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do?
If there’s no you This won’t go back to normal
If it ever was
It’s been years of hoping
And I keep saying it because 
‘Cause I have to... Ooh, you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, soon you’ll get better
Ooh, you’ll get better soon 
‘Cause you have to

Official ‘Daylight’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift 

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven
I’ll tell you the truth but never goodbye I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it’s morning now
It’s brighter now, now Chorus And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white
But it’s golden And I can still see it all in my head
Back and forth from New York
Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it’s golden
Like daylight I don’t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I could never look away
I don’t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
I’ve been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight
Like daylight
It’s golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight
And let it go
Just let it go
Let it go Spoken: 
“I want to be defined by the things that I love. Not the things I hate, not the things I’m afraid of, the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. I just think that... you are what you love.”

Official ‘Cornelia Street’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
ﬁlling in the blanks as we go
As if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead
leading us home And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
That’s the kind of heartbreak
Time could never mend
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again Windows ﬂung right open
Autumn air, jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the ﬂoor
Back when we were card sharks
Playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I Chorus You hold my hand
On the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen... I hope I never lose you 
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again 
Never again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car

Official ‘Cornelia Street’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift

We were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger
than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
ﬁlling in the blanks as we go
As if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead
leading us home And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
That’s the kind of heartbreak
Time could never mend
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again Windows ﬂung right open
Autumn air, jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the ﬂoor
Back when we were card sharks
Playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called
Showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I Chorus You hold my hand
On the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen... I hope I never lose you 
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again 
Never again
And baby I get mystiﬁed by how
this city screams your name
And baby I’m so terriﬁed of if you ever walk away
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I’d never walk Cornelia Street again
I rent a place on Cornelia Street,
I say casually in the car

Official ‘London Boy’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Cautious Clay & Mark Anthony Spears

Idris Elba: We can go driving in, on my scooter, ah you know, just round London
James Corden: Oh I love my hometown
As much as Motown
I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen
Faded blue jeans
Tennessee whiskey
But something happened
I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples ﬁrst and
then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that’s not where mine lives You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market
in the afternoon 
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet 
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you Now I love high tea
Stories from uni and the West End
You can ﬁnd me in the pub, we
Are watchin’ rugby
With his school friends
Show me a gray sky
A rainy cab ride
Babes, don’t threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God I love the English... You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton,
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet 
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you So please show me Hackney
Doesn’t have to be Louis V
Up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Stick with me, I’m your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney
On the Heath
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you, wanna be with you You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho drinking in the afternoon 
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess
All the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you So please show me Hackney
Doesn’t have to be Louis V
Up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you
Stick with me, I’m your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney
On the Heath
Just wanna be with you, wanna be with you, wanna be with you

Official Lyrics:

I like the way you sound in the morning 
We’re on the phone and without a warning 
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard 
I like the way I can’t keep my focus 
I watch you talk, you didn’t notice 
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together 

Every time you smile, I smile 
And every time you shine, I’ll shine for you 

Whoa I’m feeling you baby 
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby I’m never gonna leave you 
Say that you wanna be with me too 
Cause I’m gonna stay through it all so jump then fall 

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face 
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face 
Oh I’ve never been so wrapped up honey 
I like the way you’re everything I’ve ever wanted 
I had time to think it over and all I can say is come closer 
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me 

Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I’ll shine for you 

Repeat chorus 

The bottom’s gonna drop out from under our feet
I’ll catch you, I’ll catch you 
When people say things that bring you to your knees, I’ll catch you 
The time is gonna come when you’re so mad you could cry 
But I’ll hold you through the night until you smile 

Whoa I need you baby 
Don’t be afraid please jump then fall, jump then fall into me 
Baby I’m never gonna leave you 
Say that you wanna be with me too 
Cause I’m gonna stay through it all so jump then fall 
Jump then fall baby 
Jump then fall into me, into me 

And every time you smile, I smile 
And every time you shine, I’ll shine 
And every time you’re here baby I’ll show you 
I’ll show you you can jump then fall 
Jump then fall Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

Official Lyrics:
 
You’re on the phone with your girlfriend 
She’s upset, she’s going off about something that you said 
Cause she doesn’t get your humor like I do 

I’m in my room it’s a typical Tuesday night
I’m listening to the kind of music she doesn’t like 
And she’ll never know your story like I do 

Cause she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts 
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers 
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you wake up and find 
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time 

If you could see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me
 You belong with me 

Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans 
I can’t help thinking this is how it ought to be 
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself, hey isn’t this easy 

And you’ve got a smile that could light up this whole town 
I haven’t seen it in a while since she brought you down 
You say you’re fine I know you better than that 
Hey what you doing with a girl like that 

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers 
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers 
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you wake up and find 
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time 

If you could see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by waiting at your back door 
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 

Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night 
I’m the one who makes you laugh when you know you’re ‘bout to cry 
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams 
I think I know where you belong, I think I know it’s with me 

Can’t you see that I’m the one who understands you 
Been here all along so why can’t you see 
You belong with me 
Standing by waiting at your back door 
All this time how could you not know baby 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 
You belong with me 
Have you ever thought just maybe 
You belong with me 
You belong with me

Official Lyrics:

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave ‘em muddy underneath 
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off 
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears 
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ‘don't you wish you had me’ grin
But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned 
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears 
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned 
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we 
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried 
And I watched a part of myself die
Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I’ve still got you all over me
I’ve still got you all over me
Still got you all over me

Official Lyrics:

Today was a fairytale 
You were the prince 
I used to be a damsel in distress 
You took me by the hand 
And you picked me up at six 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 

I wore a dress 
You wore a dark grey t-shirt 
You told me I was pretty 
When I looked like a mess 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around 

But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 
You’ve got a smile 
That takes me to another planet 
Every move you make 
Everything you say is right 
Today was a fairytale 

Today was a fairytale 
All that I can say 
Is now it’s getting so much clearer 
Nothing made sense 
Till the time I saw your face 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around, yeah 

But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Time slows down 
Whenever you’re around 
I can feel my heart 
It’s beating in my chest 
Did you feel it? 
I can’t put this down 
But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 

But can you feel this magic in the air? 
It must have been the way you kissed me 
Fell in love when I saw you standing there 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 
It must have been the way 
Today was a fairytale 

Oh, oh, yeah, oh 
Today was a fairytale

Official Lyrics:

It wasn’t just like a movie 
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes 
Down to my skin 
I’m driving away and I 
I guess you could say 
This is the last time 
I'll drive this way again 
Lost in the gray and I 
Try to grab at the fray cause I 
I still love you but I can’t 

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 
Bye bye baby 
Bye bye baby 

The picture frame is empty 
On the dresser, vacant just like me 
I see your writing on the dash 
Then back to your hesitation 
I was so sure of everything 
Everything I thought we’d always have 

Guess I never doubted it 
Then the here and the now floods in 
Feels like I’m becoming 
A part of your past 

Repeat chorus 

There’s so much that I can’t touch 
You’re all I want but it’s not enough this time 
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands 
And I’m so scared 
Of how this ends 

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side 
Bye bye baby 
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing 
And all I have is your sympathy 
Cause you took me home 
But you just couldn’t keep me 

Oh, you took me home 
I thought you were gonna keep me 
Bye bye baby 
Bye bye baby
